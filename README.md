# Model Predictive Control for Path Tracking

In this project MPC controller has been implemented to manuever the vehicle around the lake race track. Unlike the PID control project where cross track error (CTE) is given by simulator, it has to be calculated by ourselves using a kinematic model and vehicle co-ordinates. Additionally, there's a latency of 100 millisecond between actuation commands on top of connection latency.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Kinematic Model

Model predictive control uses an optimizer to determine the control inputs and minimiza the cost function. The MPC setup requires definition of a kinematic model of the system, constraints, cost function and length of prediction horizon. As we are dealing with a vehicle system that tracks a desired path, we use simple bicycle kinematic model assuming that the car is symmetric about longitudinal axis. The model equations are:

```
x[t+1] = x[t] + v[t] * cos(psi[t]) * dt

y[t+1] = y[t] + v[t] * sin(psi[t]) * dt

psi[t+1] = psi[t] + v[t]/Lf * delta[t] * dt

v[t+1] = v[t] + a[t] * dt

cte[t+1] = f(x[t]) - y[t] + v[t] * sin(epsi[t]) * dt

epsi[t+1] = psi[t] - psi_des + v[t]/Lf * delta[t] * dt
```

The model has 6 states which include:

x position (x)

y position (y)

yaw angle (psi)

velocity (v)

cross track error (cte)

yaw angle error (epsi)

The two actuator inputs are:

steering angle (delta)

acceleration (a)
