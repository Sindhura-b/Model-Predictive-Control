# Model Predictive Control for Path Tracking

In this project MPC controller has been implemented to manuever the vehicle around the lake race track. Unlike the PID control project where cross track error (CTE) is given by simulator, it has to be calculated by ourselves using a kinematic model and vehicle co-ordinates. Additionally, there's a latency of 100 millisecond between actuation commands on top of connection latency.

    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.

* **Ipopt and CppAD:** Please refer to [this document](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/blob/master/install_Ipopt_CppAD.md) for installation instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Kinematic Model

Model predictive control uses an optimizer to determine the control inputs and minimiza the cost function. The MPC setup requires definition of a kinematic model of the system, constraints, cost function and length of prediction horizon. As we are dealing with a vehicle system that tracks a desired path, we use simple bicycle kinematic model assuming that the car is symmetric about longitudinal axis. The model equations are:

x[t+1]=x[t]+v[t]*cos(psi[t])*dt
y[t+1]=y[t]+v[t]*sin(psi[t])*dt
psi[t+1]=psi[t]+v[t]/L_f
